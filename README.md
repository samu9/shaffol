# shaffol

> Interactive music generator made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)

[Try it](https://samu9.github.io/shaffol/)


## How it works
Create your own original music, using a "note matrix" for each instrument and some drum patterns. You can choose a key and a scale, and every note in the matrix will follow those settings, so everything will sound good.

## Shuffle!
If you're not satified of the results, just press the shuffle button and change everything!
